"""
Merge text descriptions with sentence-level dedup and optional truncation.

Used when the same entity is seen in multiple chunks/documents: add only
new sentences from the incoming description, then truncate at sentence boundary.
Optional LLM summarizer: when total length exceeds a threshold, a callable can
produce one concise summary; fallback to sentence-dedup + truncate on failure.
Used by dict_merger, delta merge_delta_graphs, and staged merge.
